# Drinks Recipes App  
## React | useState | useEffect | useContext | API | Bootstrap React 

### As part of my practices for the React course (see info below), I have made this app to consume 3 endpoints of an API (see info below) to search for drink recipes. It is the first version, in a future version I will add the option to save favorite drinks in localStorage and suggestions based on previous searches.
